**New**

Please post any opportunities to volunteer that you want the subreddit to know about. This thread will be curated periodically to keep the events of the week fresh and visible.

**Who?**

Events don't need to be yours! You're welcome to post any interesting/fun/unknown/well known/moderately-enjoyable events. Will remove posts completely off topic (like a link to one's unrelated blog or comments about how there's nothing to do in this city)

**Tip**
